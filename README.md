DATA

The data that I used were songs by a group called Maverick City. These songs were chosen randonmly, but no cover songs were chosen. Each unit of analysis was one song and in total I collected 34 observations. In my question I wanted to anaylize if the songs by Maverick city had more views because of the number of artist in a song or because of the tempo or if it was the emotion. Did the number of artist affect the views of the song, which would mean if it was more popular because of the number of artist. I gathered my data by looking through each album and choosing songs that had different number of artist. After choosing those songs I listened to the songs to identify the different emotions and tempo. Lastly I used spotify to help identify the amount of views each song had. 

OPERATIONALIZATION

The concept of emotions was operationalized under three main categories 1. if the song gave an emotion of adoration, 2. if the song showed appreciation, and 3. if the song demontrated joy, which meant the songs message was giving out a joyful message. In this variable as some of the artist said it was important to demonstrate this type of feeling. 

The concept of tempo was operationalized in two categories. 1. being how slow the song was and 2. how fast the song was. This variable was important to consider the rhythm of the song because in the analysis I wanted to identify if there was a correlation between the tempo and the views. Did how fast or song influence the number of views? 

The concept of involvement of people that participated in singing this song was operationalized through a quantitative variable named artist count, which was measured on a scale from 1-7 people. To meausre this variable I had to watch each video and look at the number of artist that were being included in the song. 

The concept of how many people watched or listened to this particular song was operationalized through a quantitative variable named views, which was a measured on a scale from 124000 to 199,000,000. To meausre this concept I used spotify in order to see the number of views.
